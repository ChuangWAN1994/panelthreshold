Description: This function maily estimate the dynamic multiple threshold regression with threshold 
    effects and endogeneity. To handle endogeneity, we apply the rst-differenced GMM framework
    to estimate the unknown parameters for a given number of thresholds. When the number of thresholds 
    is unknown, a modified information criterion is employed to determine the model complexity.  Moreover, 
    we develop a sup-Wald test statistic to facilitate inference on threshold effects.
